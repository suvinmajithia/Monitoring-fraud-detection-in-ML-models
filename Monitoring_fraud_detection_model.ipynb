        "🛡️ Project Summary: Fraud Model Diagnostics\n",
        "I've successfully monitored Poundbank's fraud detection model using the nannyml library to diagnose the recent drop in accuracy. My analysis focused on tracking performance alerts and identifying the source of data drift.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔍 What I Found (The Results)\n",
        "My findings confirm that both model performance has degraded and the underlying data patterns have fundamentally changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Model Performance Alerts (Task 1) 📉\n",
        "\n",
        "I used Confidence-Based Performance Estimation (CBPE) to track the model's accuracy monthly. I found that both the estimated (expected) and realized (actual) accuracy dropped below the acceptable confidence band during these periods:\n",
        "\n",
        "Months with Performance Alerts (months_with_performance_alerts):\n",
        "\n",
        "Result: A list of months in the format [\"month_year\"].\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Highest Data Drift Feature (Task 2) 📈\n",
        "\n",
        "I calculated the univariate drift for all features using the recommended Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Chi-square/G-statistic tests. The feature showing the most extreme change is the one most likely responsible for destabilizing the model:\n",
        "\n",
        "Highest Correlation Feature (highest_correlation_feature):\n",
        "\n",
        "Result: The name of the single feature that exhibited the highest drift score.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Data Quality Alert: Transaction Amount (Task 3) 💰\n",
        "\n",
        "I monitored the average value of transactions to detect unusual financial activity, confirming that a key transactional metric deviated significantly from historical norms:\n",
        "\n",
        "Alert Average Transaction Amount (alert_avg_transaction_amount):\n",
        "\n",
        "Result: A single floating-point number representing the high average amount that triggered the alert, rounded to at least one decimal place.\n",
        "\n",
        "💡 Analysis: Why the Model Broke (The Extra Task)\n",
        "My drift analysis points to a significant behavioral change by fraudsters, which is the root cause of the accuracy drop.\n",
        "\n",
        "Observation: I saw two major shifts starting in Spring: the vanishing of transactions made within one minute of login, and a simultaneous increase in the average transaction amount.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion (Hypothesis of Adversarial Drift): My conclusion is that fraudsters have adapted their strategy to evade detection. They realized that rapid transactions were likely being flagged by the old model. They are now:\n",
        "\n",
        "Waiting longer after logging in to execute transactions, thereby bypassing the model's original time-based vulnerability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consolidating their theft into fewer, larger transfers to maximize efficiency and minimize exposure to detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "This adaptation created new data patterns (drift) that the old model was never trained to handle, leading directly to the performance collapse I observed."

Additionally, as you discovered in the third question, the average transaction value has increased and raised an alert.\\n\\nPossible explanation: \\n\\nFraudsters may have noticed that early card transactions, when done right after logging in, often led to account blocking. As a result, they began waiting a bit longer before transferring money to their account to avoid detection. Furthermore, they tend to make a single larger transfer instead of many smaller ones, leading to an increase in the average transaction value.\\n'"
